My first interaction with open-source happened back in 2014, and I was immediately captivated by the concept. The idea of people collaborating openly, across borders, with a shared goal of creating something better fascinated me. At the time, I didnâ€™t contribute much code, largely due to imposter syndrome, which was in full swing. Yet, even then, I sensed that contributing to open-source wasnâ€™t just about writing code. People can give back in so many other ways. 

So, I found my own path, helping by securing funding for one of the projects and [promoting tools at conferences](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-1goNbdBkc&t=1652s).

Now I work full-time on open-source projects, focusing on community-driven initiatives. This adventure began in February 2020, and Iâ€™ve never looked back. My primary focus is on the [AsyncAPI Initiative](https://www.asyncapi.com/), where I serve as a maintainer, a member of the Technical Steering Committee, and the Executive Director.

In addition to my technical work, Iâ€™m passionate about educating people on the value of open-sourceâ€”teaching companies how they can get involved and why investing in open-source is a crucial decision for their future success.

In other words, from my experience I'm good at:

- :heart: Being a good person for others, at least I try
- ðŸ’¬ Talking to people from different areas
- ðŸ“– Writing docs and designing information architecture
- ðŸ’» Writing code of I think a decent quality
- ðŸŽ¨ Designing and driving development of technical solutions
- ðŸ“¢ Presenting at meetups and conferences

When I have time, I write on my blog [brainfart.dev]([https://dev.to/derberg](https://www.brainfart.dev/)) and [AsyncAPI Blog](https://www.asyncapi.com/blog?authors=Lukasz+Gornicki). You can sponsor me through [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/derberg), or contact directly for other hiring options.
