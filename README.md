I'm an open-source freak that started his career as a tech writer, then got into development to later become a product owner that because of being an open-source freak started working as community manager too. In other words, from my experience I'm good at:
- Talking to people from different areas
- Writing docs and designing information architecture
- Writing code of I think a decent quality
- Designing and driving development of technical solutions
- Being a good person for others, at least I try

I'm working now as a maintainer and community guardian at [AsyncAPI Initiative](https://www.asyncapi.com/). We are a great community of people shaping the future of how you work with #eventdrivenarchitecture, no matter if it is Kafka or Websockets. [Join and talk to us](https://www.asyncapi.com/slack-invite/).
