I'm an open-source freak :sweat_smile: that started his career as a tech writer, then got into development to later become a product owner that because of being an open-source freak started working as community manager too. Complicated sentence, huh? :wink:

In other words, from my experience I'm good at:

- :heart: Being a good person for others, at least I try
- 💬 Talking to people from different areas
- 📖 Writing docs and designing information architecture
- 💻 Writing code of I think a decent quality
- 🎨 Designing and driving development of technical solutions
- 📢 Presenting at meetups and conferences

I'm working now as a maintainer 🚧 and community guardian 🦸🏻‍♂️ at [AsyncAPI Initiative](https://www.asyncapi.com/). We are a great community :open_hands: shaping the future of how you work with #eventdrivenarchitecture, no matter if it is Kafka or Websockets. [Join and talk to us](https://www.asyncapi.com/slack-invite/).
